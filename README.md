NodeChatApplication 
=========

NodeChatApplication is a real time chat application developed using node.js(express framework) and socket.io. Unlike LAMP applications, It doesn't use any database for storing and fetching chats. Instead it push the chat to all users connected at that time in real time.

Building NodeChatApplication
---------
[Once you have downloaded zip-file](https://github.com/varunon9/NodeChatApplication) run the index.js file using following command from terminal. Note that you must have node installed on your computer. Enter localhost:3100/ address in your browser and on login page, enter your name and use password 'makerparty'. (Obviously you can edit it from index.js file). You can enter the same address in multiple tabs or in multiple browsers for demonstration.

    node index.js 
        or
    nodemon index.js


 See the working demo at <http://188.166.84.159:3100/> password is <makerparty>. Share this address to your friend and start chatting.
